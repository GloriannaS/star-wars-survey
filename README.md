# Star Wars Survey

As the Star Wars franchise continued to grow, debates began, and continue to arise over what part of the franchise is the best. Which film in the series was the franchise’s “Golden Age”? As the release date for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) approached, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/) became curious about exploring various questions related to Star Wars fans. Ultimately, after surveying over 800 respondents, they compiled a large dataset containing the results.

In this short project, we will work with the `star_wars.csv` data set. It will be a short cleaning project, ending with a brief initial analysis. Our goal is to demonstrate data cleaning techniques with data acquired through crowd questioning, which is often quite dirtied and disorganized.
